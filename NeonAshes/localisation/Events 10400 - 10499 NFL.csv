EVT_10400_NAME;Patriation and the Future;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10400_DESC;Independence brought new challenges to the young nation. During the 1970s, fishing disputes between Canada and, later on Quebec, threatened the livelihood of the Newfoundlanders. American investments dried up as the cold war ground to a halt with the disintegration of blocs and, shortly thereafter, of the superpowers theselves.\n\nHowever, independence brought the natural resources of Labrador and the Grand Banks under the full control of St. John's, and the possible location of oil may give the national economy a necessary boost.\n\nSurrounded by formerly stable friends, there is no immediate risk to Newfoundland's security, but only time will tell what course the young nation will chart between the American juggernauts and the Atlantic waters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
