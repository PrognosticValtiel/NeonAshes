sign_articles_of_dissolution_desc;The Articles of Dissolution were signed by most of the former American nations in December 1979, with the notable exceptions of Californa and Texas, as there was no well-established legitimate government for either. After their government is restored, it is possible for them to sign the Articles of Dissolution for a mutual understanding between them and the rest of the former American nations. Conversely, they could postpone its signing, or even refuse to do so altogether, charting their own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Any signatory could, however, unilaterally withdraw from them, and assert total independence from the rest of the former American nations. Given the difficulties of signing and ratifying them at first, it is unlikely, if not outright implausible, to rejoin them once leaving them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
