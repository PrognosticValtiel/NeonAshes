EVT_10700_NAME;The October Crisis and Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10700_DESC;In October 1970, the separatist group Quebec Liberation Front (FLQ) kidnapped provincial Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte and the British diplomat James Cross. This prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to invoke the War Measures Act to arrest and detain the perpetrators.\n\nThe heavy-handedness of Federal troops in Quebec was far more than imagined, with almost a thousand suspects detained, and public images of violence quickly galvanized public support for the FLQ and distrust for Ottawa, which had suffered political blows from the passing of the White Paper and the increasing alienation of the Western provinces.\n\nIn 1973, the nationalist Quebec Party swept through the polls, and two years later proposed a referendum to "negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada," in effect a referendum on their independence, which was narrowly approved. This set up the stage for the creation of the Canadian Political and Economic Compacts between the provinces in 1978, granting full autonomy to Quebec, along with the other Canadian nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
