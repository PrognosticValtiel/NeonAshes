EVT_10600_NAME;The Three Crises;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10600_DESC;The 1968 federal election saw the narrow victory of Liberal candidate Pierre Trudeau to the premiership of Canada, under the banner of quelling down Quebecois separatism, integrating the geographically and culturally separate peoples of Canada, and inject fresh blood into an aging political and party apparatus. However, the pressures from the indigenous peoples, Quebecois, and Western Canadians were too much to bear at once and, overplaying his hand, Trudeau cracked down hard on dissent, with bloody results.\n\nAn unlikely alliance formed between the dissenters aiming to devolve Canada and reduce the power of Ottawa, cemented by the electoral victories of Quebecois nationalists in 1973 and Progressive Conservatives a year later, resulting in the "renegotiation" of Canadian domestic policies with the Canadian Political and Economic Compacts.\n\nThus, Ontario became a quasi-independent State within the Compacts, co-equal with the other Canadian states, and finding its place within the new Canada, and the new world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
