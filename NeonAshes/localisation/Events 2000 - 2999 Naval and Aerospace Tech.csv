EVT_2310_NAME;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_2310_DESC;Given the recent government interest in aerospace, a symposium of aeronautic engineers, professors, physicists and experts gathered earlier today at $CAPITAL$ to discuss the potential establishment of a National Space Agency, with proposals ranging from a modest private-led agency to a sprawling public space program. The meeting was attended by experts of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Academy of Science and a few curious officers from the Armed Forces, who informed us of the results.\n\nIn all accounts, $COUNTRY$ is in an ideal position to establish a space agency, whether private or public, in order to kick-start development in aerospace matters, although some more ambitious proponents call for the establishment of a proper space program with the ultimate goal of manned human spaceflight across the Solar System.\n\nAfter presenting their conclusions to lawmakers, it was decreed that the nation of $COUNTRY$ will have...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_2311_DESC;After a few failed launches and trial runs, scientists at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency accomplished the successful launch of our first satellite into orbit. While carrying nothing more than a simple battery and telemetry package to relay data back to Earth, the satellite represents a significant step in our space program, and a boon to our national pride.\n\nThe data gathered from this launch includes outer space analysis into aerodynamics, the magnetosphere, and orbital dynamics, all incredibly useful endeavors for future satellites and, eventually, manned missions.\n\nRocketeers at the Space Agency are insisting that, provided appropiate funding, manned space flight is just a couple of years away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_2312_DESC;Scientists at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency have successfully launched an animal into outer space!\n\nThe launch came after a long study on animal survivability for both ascent and recovery, and a short list of five candidates for the first mission was drawn up: a chimpanzee, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Shorthair, a pair of doves, a common mixed-breed dog, and an eagle.\n\nWhile scientists are eager to use a wide variety of animals later on and insist all candidates will provide useful data, they have delegated the final choice to the leaders at $CAPITAL$ due to the scientific, cultural and historic significance of the occasion and, after proper review and consideration, a final decision was reached, and the selected animal was launched into space:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_2313_DESC;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency has successfully launched our first manned mission into space! Although it is a short mission that won't reach a single orbit, it is nevertheless a major accomplishment and a stepping stone in our reach for the stars.\n\nAll eyes in $CAPITAL$ are glued to the screens to watch the launch and live commentary of the trip, including the biography of the the young and charming Lieutenant that became the first $COUNTRY_ADJ$ in space, who has been a surprisingly charismatic media figure, and has captivated the hearts and minds of our people.\n\nIn a final pre-mission interview that has been repeatedly replayed during slow moments, he expressed his excitement for this historical mission, and wanted to briefly express his admiration for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_2314_DESC;Scientists, engineers and administrators from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency gathered today at $CAPITAL$ to discuss funding for their agency with politicians and pundits who considered the agency "bloated" and "inefficient."\n\nSupporters of increased funding saw the benefits that the agency had provided in matters of science, innovation, and even popular endeavors. Detractors saw an inefficient agency who did not provide nearly as much as it would provide to the country, especially when considering the time between major breakthroughs or achievements.\n\nAfter presenting both views for lawmakers to consider, it was decided that $COUNTRY$'s space policy will consist chiefly of...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_2318_NAME;Satellite Launch Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_2318_DESC;Earlier today, the first attempt to get a satellite into orbit by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency ended in dramatic failure. Shortly after liftoff, a flaw in the propulsion system led to a loss of thrust and, shortly thereafter, the explosion of the rocket vehicle and its payload.\n\nAlthough the exact causes of the accident are yet to be determined, our engineers think it is likely to have been low tank pressure in a fuel tank, or a loose fuel connection. These problems, they assure us, are a consequence of our lack of experience with rocket launches of this size and ambition, and they are working hard to resolve these, and any other issue that may arise in the failure of our future launches, especially for possible future manned missions.\n\nDespite the setback, we can be thankful that no lives were lost in this accident, and our engineers are convinced that it will not affect the long term prospects of our space program.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_2319_NAME;Satellite Launch Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_2319_DESC;The attempted launch (and failure) of the Telesto 2 satellite earlier today is the latest of a string of rocket launch failures in $COUNTRY$. For the third time in less than two months, we have suffered from rockets failing to reach orbit, with the last two resulting in fiery explosions just a couple minutes into the flight.\n\nPreliminary reports from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency can't find a common cause on these accidents and, although alarming to the engineers in $CAPITAL$, it seems to be a string of very bad luck. Regardless, there are calls to perform a stringent review of our launch vehicles to fully discard any possible engineering or management causes of these failures.\n\nDespite these setbacks, we can be thankful that no lives were lost in these accidents, and our engineers assure us that they will not affect the long term prospects of our space program.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_2321_DESC;All across $COUNTRY$ people are either following the latest spaceflight news on their screens, or raising their gaze to the heavens, to try and catch a glimpse of our first astronaut in orbit. The young and intrepid traveller is scheduled for seven orbits across the planet, before de-orbiting and landing safe and sound.\n\nFolks at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency are confident of the safe return of the capsule, and leaders at $CAPITAL$ are already jostling to take credit over this momentous achievement and to gauge its significance. As the signals from the capsule are broadcast and retransmitted, vanguardist historians and sociologists have reached an early consensus on its memorability in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ history books: our first orbital flight has provided...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_2322_DESC;For the first time, two $COUNTRY_ADJ$ space capsules, launched at different times, rendezvous in space and manage to dock with each other. While this mission has not managed to attract the attention of the masses as our previous crewed missions, it has been an impressive technological achievement and a major milestone in our spacefaring endeavors.\n\nThe literal and allegorical significance of this achievement has not been ignored by the journalists and pundits, who framed this mission as one of unity in space. With this good PR, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency, along with guidance from $CAPITAL$, has refined the public message to focus on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Scientists are already aiming for future missions to build upon the discoveries attained from this one, and they expect that, given enough resources, we can put a man on the moon in less than a decade.\n\nBesides carrying scientific instruments for telemetry data, the probe had a small ceremonial payload to deliver to the moon, and given the remarkable occasion, officials in $CAPITAL$ had agreed that the best cargo to memorialize our first object around and on the moon was going to be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Scientists and engineers consider our technical and scientific capabilities, poets and patriots the stellar nature of $COUNTRY$, philosophers and internationalists consider our achievement as a stepping stone for mankind, sociologists credit an unusually calm period in our recent history, and politicians laud our government's stability.\n\nUltimately, the prevailing opinion of the man on the street is that this success stems from...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

The culmination of decades of hard work from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Program, visible for all, as the astronauts suit up and brace themselves for leaving the lander.\n\n"I'm at the foot of the ladder. The surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder.
