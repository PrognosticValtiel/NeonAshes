lyocell_rayon;Lyocell Rayon;;;;;;;;;;X
lyocell_rayon_desc;Lyocell is a type of rayon made from the dissolution of cellulose products in the chemical solvent N-methyl morpholine N-oxide. The lyocell process is more expensive than the viscose process, although it has less waste products than other rayon manufacturing methods.;;;;;;;;;;X
conductive_polymers;Conductive Polymers;;;;;;;;;;X
conductive_polymers_desc;Conductive polymers or, more precisely, intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) are organic polymers that conduct electricity. Such compounds may have metallic conductivity or can be semiconductors. Their range of uses include anti-static materials, displays, batteries, printed electronic circuits, light-emitting diodes, and sensors.;;;;;;;;;;X
high_performance_plastics;High Performance Plastics;;;;;;;;;;X
high_performance_plastics_desc;High-performance plastics are highly specialized polymers that meet higher requirements than standard or engineering plastics. They are more expensive and used in smaller amounts where specific chemical or mechanical properties are desired, such as top-of-the-line electrical insulation, automotive and aerospace materials, and advanced chemical processing.;;;;;;;;;;X
aerogel;Aerogel;;;;;;;;;;X
aerogel_desc;Aerogel is a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel, in which the liquid component for the gel has been replaced with a gas, without significant collapse of the gel structure. The result is a solid with extremely low density and extremely low thermal conductivity. They possess a wide range of uses: lightweight thermal and sound insulation, optics, paints, chemical catalysts and scientific sensors, among many others.;;;;;;;;;;X
duplex_stainless_steel;Duplex Stainless Steel;;;;;;;;;;X
duplex_stainless_steel_desc;Duplex stainless steels are a family of stainless steels, called duplex (or austenitic-ferritic) grades because their metallurgical structure consists of two phases, austenite (face-centered cubic lattice) and ferrite (body centered cubic lattice) in roughly equal proportions. They are designed to provide better corrosion resistance, particularly chloride stress corrosion and chloride pitting corrosion, and higher strength than standard austenitic stainless steels.;;;;;;;;;;X
amorphous_metals;Amorphous Metals;;;;;;;;;;X
amorphous_metals_desc;Amorphous metals (also known as metallic glass or glassy metals) are a solid metallic material, usually an alloy, with disordered atomic-scale structure. Most metals are crystalline in their solid state, having a highly ordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals are non-crystalline, and have a glass-like structure. Unlike common glasses, which are typically electrical insulators, amorphous metals have good electrical conductivity and display superconductivity at low temperatures.;;;;;;;;;;X
rare_earth_metal_alloys;Rare-Earth Metal Alloys;;;;;;;;;;X
rare_earth_metal_alloys_desc;Rare-earth metal alloys are mixtures of rare earth elements and more common metals to achieve specialized materials used in a wide range of industries, including as catalysts, magnets, ceramics, glass, electronics, batteries, and renewable energy sources.;;;;;;;;;;X
carbon_fiber;Carbon Fiber;;;;;;;;;;X
carbon_fiber_desc;Carbon fibers, or graphite fibers, are fibers about 5 to 10 micrometers in diameter and composed mostly of carbon atoms. Carbon fibers possess several desirable qualities: high stiffness, high tensile strength, high strength to weight ratio, high chemical resistance, high-temperature tolerance, and low thermal expansion. These properties have made carbon fiber very popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, motorsports, and other competition sports.;;;;;;;;;;X
syntactic_foams;Syntactic Foams;;;;;;;;;;X
syntactic_foams_desc;Syntactic foams are composite materials synthesized by filling a metal, polymer, or ceramic matrix with hollow spheres called microballoons or cenospheres or non-hollow spheres (e.g. perlite). The presence of hollow particles results in lower density, higher specific strength, lower coefficient of thermal expansion, and, in some cases, radar or sonar transparency materials.;;;;;;;;;;X
ultra_high_temperature_ceramic_composites;Ultra-High Temperature Ceramic Composites;;;;;;;;;;X
ultra_high_temperature_ceramic_composites_desc;Ultra-high-temperature ceramic composites (UHTCs) are a class of refractory ceramics that offer excellent stability at temperatures exceeding 2000 degrees Celsius with uses as thermal protection system materials, coatings for materials subjected to high temperatures, and bulk materials for heating elements. Broadly speaking, UHTCs are borides, carbides, nitrides, and oxides of early transition metals.;;;;;;;;;;X
synthetic_diamonds;Synthetic Diamonds;;;;;;;;;;X
synthetic_diamonds_desc;Synthetic diamonds are those produced in a controlled technological process, in contrast to naturally formed diamond, which is created through geological processes and obtained by mining. Synthetic diamonds are composed of the same material as naturally formed diamonds, pure carbon crystallized in an isotropic 3D form, and share identical chemical and physical properties, and thus, widely used as industrial diamonds.;;;;;;;;;;X
