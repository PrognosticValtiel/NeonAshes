EVT_7000_DESC;The top minds of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Academy of Sciences gathered today in $CAPITAL$ at the government's request. It was decreed that, in the name of the national interest, the academia of $COUNTRY$, its universities, researchers and scientists should focus on a specific field of study.\n\nThe war and defense hawks are calling for a reinvigorated focus on our nation's military, encouraging research and development on weapons systems, doctrines, ships, and aircraft, and point at the deteriorating strategic situation in our region. Economists and sociologists, however, would rather push for broad internal development in our cultural, political, financial and industrial areas as the best way to drive the nation forward at this point in time.\n\nThe debate was long settled before the meeting, however, and the prevailing views from the legislators to the intelligentsia was clear:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_7010_DESC;As we gear our academia towards military affairs, there have been calls from the Ministry of Defense and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Academy of Sciences to focus our research even further.\n\nThere are currently two main schools of military thought vying for funding and research availability: the Defense and Deterrence School, which focuses on overall strategic military readiness and land combat to better safeguard our nation from attacks, and the Power Projection School, that seeks to develop air, sea, and space technologies to better project power abroad and bolster our attack capabilities.\n\nFocusing our research into either will improve our overall research efficiency, although it will benefit some at the expense of others, and may reduce our strategic flexibility in research topics. After several weeks of discussion, it was agreed that the best course of action was to:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_7020_DESC;The recent advancements in military science have brought calls from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Defense to broaden the scope of our research into synergistic fields of study. This has led to a schism between four different schools of thought on which fields we should focus on.\n\nThe Classical Military school contends that the best way to complement our defense and deterrence is through research in air and sea weaponry as well. The so-called Mercenary school contends that economic and financial progress goes hand-in-hand with military prowess. The Regimented Society school calls for greater civil-military union. Lastly, the Military-Industrial school seeks to expand our nation's industrial capacity as the best way to benenfit our armed forces.\n\nEventually, it was decided that the best way to refine the Defense and Deterrence school was to follow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
