EVT_7400_NAME;Defunding our Space Program;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7400_DESC;With their annual budget review in the coming days, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Program is facing severe criticism in the public spheres due to the largesse of their assigned budget in contrast with the economic situation in the country.\n\nWhile popular rumors of gold-coated rocket nozzles are mostly false, recent cases of graft and contractor overcharge have made the Agency's budget the talk in $CAPITAL$, and even government economists agree that we can make significant budget cuts with only marginal losses to planned and ongoing missions.\n\nThe main opposition to budget cuts remains the scientists, who claim that reductions in the budget will at least delay, if not place permanently on hold, several key missions for both the Earth and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7400_OPTA;The budget will remain as-is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7400_OPTB;Reduce the budget to the requested level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7400_OPTC;These cuts don't go far enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_7401_DESC;With their annual budget review in the coming days, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Program is facing very intense criticism in the public spheres due to their assigned budget levels in contrast with the mediocre economic situation in the country.\n\nDespite recent improvements in management and sourcing efficiency fighting against graft and contractor overcharge, the Agency's budget remains a matter of debate in $CAPITAL$, with many claiming that its budget can be cut to provide for more pressing economic and social needs.\n\nThe main opposition to budget cuts remains the scientists, who claim that reductions in the budget will certainly place permanently on hold several key missions for both the Earth and beyond, and even the cancellation of important research programs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_7402_DESC;With their annual budget review in the coming days, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Program is facing intense criticism in the public spheres due to the pressing needs of other budgetary and social concerns in the middle of a serious economic downturn.\n\nDespite its limited funds, the Agency's budget has a growing body of vocal critics in $CAPITAL$, wondering why are we sending money to space and not in bringing jobs back to $COUNTRY$ in the middle of a crisis.\n\nWhile scientists and economists mostly agree that further cuts would require the termination of ongoing missions and would result in greater economic harm through lost revenue, the popular support for budget cuts is hard to ignore, even if many are hopeful for a return to higher budget levels once the economic situation stabilizes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7402_OPTA;The budget will remain as-is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7402_OPTB;The cuts are painful, but necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7402_OPTC;We need to stop public funding of our space agency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7403_NAME;Defunding our Space Agency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7403_DESC;With their annual budget review in the coming days, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Space Agency is facing serious criticism in the public spheres due to the economic collapse of our nation.\n\nThe bare-bones Agency is seen as an unaffordable luxury by a growing number of politicians and for the society at large, who would much rather see the money spent in more pressing matters, such as education, healthcare, or food.\n\nThe Agency is already one of the smallest segments of the budget, and most experts agree that privatization would be more harmful, even in the short term, than keeping it as-is, but mounting economic dissent makes it a tough pill to swallow for many. There are hopes among them that, once the economic situation improves, the Agency will be re-established with public funds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7403_OPTA;The budget is already minimal, we will keep it as-is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7403_OPTB;We have no choice but to suspend public funding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
