EVT_10500_DESC;By the 1970s, the territories of Yukon and the Northwest Territories were, alongside the rest of Canada, calling for devolution, even if there was no agreement on its final outcome.\n\nThe prevailing sentiment in Whitehorse and Yellowknife called for the establishment of an independent protectorate to receive economic benefits and military protection from the stronger Canadian provinces, while preserving internal autonomy. Events in Vancouver, Regina and Montreal overshadowed territorial demands, and resulted in the complete dissolution of Canadian statehood, including the indeterminate status of Yukon and the Northwest Territories.\n\nThus, both Canadian territories decided to join under the unified name of the Northwest Territories Autonomous Region and, with independence thrust onto them, began the challenging process of nation-building. Whether this entails closer relationships with Western or Eastern Canada, or with the States, or as a fully independent nation, remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
