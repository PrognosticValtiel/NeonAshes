EVT_10300_NAME;Forced Independence and Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10300_DESC;As world trade slowed down in the late 60s and Quebecois nationalism surged in the early 70s, the economic stability of the Maritimes began to wane, and then to stagnate. The federal government in Ottawa was busy with pressing problems in the Western provinces and Quebec, and the plight of the Maritimes fell to the wayside.\n\nHowever, it was acknowledged that they could not succeed with full independence, especially not as three separate provinces. In 1976, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island merged into the Union of the Canadian Maritimes in an attempt to wrestle more power in the collapsing Canadian nation, but it was far too late.\n\nTwo years later, with the establishment of the Canadian Compacts, the Maritimes became their own autonomous nation within the Compacts and the government in Halifax has, for better or worse, full economic and political autonomy to chart the future of its new nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
