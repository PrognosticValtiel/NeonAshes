Perhaps dissent was too high, and the common folk were reluctanct to indulge in partisan messages. Or, we simply did not have the proper know-how and tools to run an effective information campaign given our circumstances.\n\nIn any case, the citizenship has been left, if not more ideologically aligned, at least more politically engaged. We could try with a new campaign, although sociologists from $CAPITAL$ are pessimistic on our odds unlesss we solve the underlying issues first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_7199_NAME;Propaganda Campaign - Backfire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7199_DESC;Despite our best efforts, the Ultranationalist information campaign in $COUNTRY$ has not only failed, but it has managed to alienate a significant portion of our population from our ideals!\n\nSociologists in $CAPITAL$ pin the blame on the charged political atmosphere in $COUNTRY$, that has made our nation incredibly polarized in all sorts of topics, and extremely cynical of our information efforts. They advise that this can be curtailed through reducing dissent and improving our sociological and psychological studies to better reach the masses.\n\nAlthough most agree it is only a temporary setback, it may take years to fully restore our political popularity in the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_7199_OPTA;How could this happen!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
