Some economists tout the benenfits of small positive inflation and a short term boost to the government coffers, and consider that a slightly depreciating currency will be more benenficial to investments than a slightly appreciating one, although others consider the minor currency appreciation a natural fluctuation of the markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
