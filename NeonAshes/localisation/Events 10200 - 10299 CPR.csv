EVT_10200_DESC;Facing internal economic pressure, growing calls for autonomy from Quebec and the Plains, the Liberal government in Ottawa accepted to negotiate a new framework between the Canadian provinces, lest the provinces rise up in open revolt against Ottawa.\n\nWith the victory of Nationalists in Quebec in 1973, it was all but inevitable to devolve power to the provinces and territories. However, the ultimate indecisiveness of the delegates on a Federal structure other than minimum defence and economic frameworks meant that the Canadian compacts fully disintegrated the Canadian state into a loose confederation of independent nations in all but name.\n\nAfter the British Columbia snuff in the Halifax conference in 1978, the United Provinces of the Canadian Prairies coalesced around Regina to pursue their interests under this new organization. Perhaps, once more, the future of Canada is looking west.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
