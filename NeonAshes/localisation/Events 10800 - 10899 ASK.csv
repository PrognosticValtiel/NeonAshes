EVT_10800_NAME;The Good Friday Earthquake and Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10800_DESC;On Good Friday, March 27th, 1964, the strongest earthquake in American history struck Alaska.\n\nLasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, it caused massive damage across the Pacific coast, and especially in the ports of Anchorage and Valdez. Federal aid was desperately needed, but it was conditional on the federalization of Alaska's natural resources. This time, Alaskans not only refused, but demanded the expulsion of the federal troops stationed there and, met with refusal, Alaska declared itself "in rebellion" in 1967.\n\nUnwilling to commit troops, and tied up with dissent and instability in the Lower 48, Washington acquiesed. But by then, the flames of revolution had been stoked, and the state declared independence in 1972, just four years before the dissolution of the United States. Historians argue whether it was the first domino that led to its demise, or just another link in the chain of the collapse, but they all agree that, given the circumstances, it was inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_10801_NAME;The Red Dog Mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10801_DESC;Land surveys from the 1950s have pointed to large mineral deposits in the western Brooks range in northwestern Alaska. Our surveys have confirmed this, and have identified a particularly suitable location at the Red Dog creek, with significant reserves of zinc and other metals. Current estimates give us between thirty and fifty years of profitable operations, notwithstanding technological advancements or further deposits discovered, and leaders from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ mining industry have put forth potential projects, awaiting initital funding and approval from $CAPITAL$ to begin operations.\n\nAs the news of the mine reached the capital, however, environmental and other interest groups have shown opposition to mining in hitherto pristine lands, and have mounted a small (but vocal) opposition campaign against the mine. They claim the region would be better left as-is, although some have suggested, as a compromise, the development of the timber industry alongside protections for the present forests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10801_OPTA;Approve development of the Red Dog Mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10801_OPTB;We should instead encourage the nearby boreal timber industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10801_OPTC;Leave the province as is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10802_NAME;The Red Dog Mine - Abundant Resources;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10802_DESC;The initial years of the Red Dog mine proved to exceed even the most optimistic expectations. The zinc deposits have proven to be some of the largest and most accessible across the world, and thousands have flocked to the region, both as direct and indirect workers for the mine.\n\nAlmost immediately, government officials in $CAPITAL$ have considered the economic and strategic advantage of the mine as not only the cornerstone of the local economy, but of $COUNTRY$'s general interest, and are following the development of the mining operations in the region with optimism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10802_OPTA;The mine is incredibly productive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10803_NAME;The Red Dog Mine - Significant Resources;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10803_DESC;The Red Dog Mine has exhausted the most readily-available veins, and is expanding operations towards less-profitable deposits. While entrepreneurs are scouting the region for new resources, it is becoming increasingly unlikely they will reach the high levels of productivity it achieved in the past.\n\nRegardless, the mine is still expected to remain operational and profitable for at least a decade, and its large deposits make it one of the most competitive sources of metals (particularly Zinc) in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10803_OPTA;Still quite rich and profitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10804_NAME;The Red Dog Mine - Average Resources;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10804_DESC;After decades of ore extraction, the Red Dog mine has reached a productivity level equivalent to other mines around the world. Barring new advances in mining or newly-discovered deposits, it will likely remain just that - average - for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10804_OPTA;Unfortunate, but it was expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10805_NAME;The Red Dog Mine - Dwindling Resources;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10805_DESC;After many decades, the Red Dog mine is starting to exhaust its resources. While there are still metal and mineral deposits, its acquisition is becoming harder and harder.\n\nVoices from $CAPITAL$ are calling to shut down the mine and gear the local economy for the timber or fishing industry. Mining executives claim, however, that the mine still has enough resources for at least a decade more, and technological and geological advances may prove to extend the lifespan of the mine even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10805_OPTA;Let's keep it open for now, but start preparing for its eventual closure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10806_NAME;The Red Dog Mine - Scarce Resources;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10806_DESC;The Red Dog mine has exhausted most of the mineral resources in the region, and there is talk of shutting down the mine for good. While there are still enough minerals to continue mining operations, it's becoming increasingly less profitable to operate, and we may need to provide limited government assistance to carry on mining.\n\nIf the mine were to close, we expect most of the workers in the province to return to the fishing industry, although we can also invest into boreal timber management that's prevalent in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10806_OPTA;This mine is a strategic asset, we must keep it operating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10806_OPTB;Perhaps it is time to close down the mine for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10806_OPTC;Timber is just as strategic and almost as lucrative as metals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10807_NAME;The Red Dog Mine - Exhausted Resources;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10807_DESC;All profitable metal resources have been exhausted from the Red Dog mine, and the mine owners are looking to sell the lands and equipment. Executives and politicians met at $CAPITAL$ to discuss the future of the mine, and while most are agreeable on the need to sell, hardliners are calling for the nationalization of the mine and keep it in operation to extract the last gram of resources before shutting it down.\n\nIf the mine were to close, we can encourage the local economy to return to the fishing industry, or we can invest in boreal timber that's prevalent in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10807_OPTA;Nationalize the mine, it is a vital asset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10807_OPTB;It is time to close down the mine for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10807_OPTC;Timber is just as strategic and almost as lucrative as metals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10811_NAME;The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10811_DESC;In the 1960s, the discovery of the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field put Alaska in the minds of oil tycoons and energy magnates. The field, located in the northernmost reaches of Alaska, proved to have the largest oil reserves in North America.\n\nThe challenge, however, was not just to drill the oil, but to pump it south, to the more populated regions of Alaska, and perhaps to the rest of the world. Thus, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was born, starting in the North Slope, and ending at the port city of Valdez, pumping hundreds of thousands - and even millions - of babrrels of oil per day.\n\nWork on the pipeline came to a halt in the 70s due to the chaotic political and economic situation in America, but it was resumed after Alaska declared independence in 1976. After almost five years of work, it is now ready to begin operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
