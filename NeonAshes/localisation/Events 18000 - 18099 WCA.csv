EVT_18000_NAME;$FROMCOUNTRY$ demands integration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18000_DESC;The political integration process over the western regions of Canada have led to the rise of a regional power, $FROMCOUNTRY$. And they now claim our lands as their own.\n\nPolitically, economically, and militarily, they have superiority over us, and many of our citizens even sympathize with the cause of Canadian unification, with some arguing reintegration into a larger Union is the better way to go.\n\nHowever, nationalists in $CAPITAL$ are dead-set in resisting, and are willing to fight to the bitter end to preserve the independence of our State.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the decision is patently clear:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18000_OPTA;We have no choice but to accept (Game over).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18000_OPTB;We must resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18001_NAME;The Unification of West Canada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18001_DESC;Despite the adherence to the Canadian Compacts, the self-proclaimed nation of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has emerged in the region. Although the Canadian Compacts were designed to avoid the rising of a hegemonic power, thus far their conduct has been in line with the Compacts, and official reactions have yet to be issued.\n\nWe can keep our positive relationship with them, recognizing them and their ambitions. We could adopt a more cautious attitude, which seems to be in-line with both domestic and international expectations. Or, we could recognize their flagrant violation of the Canadian Compacts and stand our ground in the international scene.\n\nWhatever our choice, it is clear that the politics of western Canada have now changed significantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18001_OPTA;They were friends before, they are still friends now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18001_OPTB;We wish them luck, but nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18001_OPTC;This is clearly against the spirit of the Canadian Compacts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18002_NAME;The Unification of West Canada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18002_DESC;Almost overnight, a new power arose in the region: the self-proclaimed nation of $FROMCOUNTRY$, a situation that the Canadian Compacts were designed to stop. Diplomats in $CAPITAL$ are scrambling to make sense of the situation and to ascertain the best course of action.\n\nSome are calling for immediate diplomatic recognition and positive relationships with them as the best course of action. The plurality consensus is to cautiously acknowledge them and treating them as any other nation. Some, however, are claiming that the Canadian Compacts are irrevocably thanks to the expansionistic ambitions of $FROMCOUNTRY$, and thus, we are not bound by them either.\n\nWhatever our choice, it is clear that the politics of western Canada have now changed significantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18002_OPTA;Friendly relations with them is of paramount interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18002_OPTB;We wish them luck, but nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_18002_OPTC;The Canadian Compact is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
