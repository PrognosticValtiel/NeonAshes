EVT_1110_NAME;Meeting of the General Staff;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_1110_DESC;After months of theoretical development, analysis, and politicking, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$'s General Staff met today in $CAPITAL$ to work out a single, unified doctrine for all branches of the military. The myriad of proposals were narrowed to three tried-and-true proposals:\n\nSome officers have expressed support for swift attacks and operations with overwhelming technical superiority, dubbed 'Air-Land Battle.' Other officers support long-lasting operations that use the entire arsenal of the military and government to operate deep into the battlefield and outlast their defenses, a strategy aptly-named 'Deep Battle operations.' Lastly, some officers seek to mobilize our population for combat, and overwhelm the enemy in a protracted war, in a 'People's War.'\n\nAfter debating their merits and flaws with the officer corps, the leadership of $COUNTRY$ decided to pick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_1120_DESC;The debate in $COUNTRY_ADJ$'s General Staff regarding the best military doctrine for $COUNTRY$'s current situation reached a tentative agreement in $CAPITAL$ earlier today. Given our present strategic situation, three proposals were put forth for final approval:\n\nYounger officers consider that wars should be quick and decisively won through technical superiority with 'Shock and Awe' against our foes. Older officers support a more population-focused approach to reduce insurgency and help bring them to our side, winning their 'Hearts and Minds.' Lastly, some officers consider our situation to be too precarious for normal operations, and insist we wage an 'Asymmetric War' against our enemies, using our population at large.\n\nAfter debating their merits and flaws with the officer corps, the leadership of $COUNTRY$ decided to pick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_1121_DESC;Over the last few months, our officer corps has been working in refining the Air-Land Battle doctrine used by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Armed Forces. They have developed a new doctrine, called 'Shock and Awe,' that applies the latest technological and military advances to Air-Land Battle, allowing swifter domination of our enemies in the battlefield.\n\nAlternatively, younger officers and pundits are calling for a meeting of the General Staff in $CAPITAL$ to implement different doctrines that are, in their view, more aligned with the present national situation. This will, of course, lead to some disorganization as the doctrinal changes are implemented through the chain of command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_1130_DESC;The debate in $COUNTRY_ADJ$'s General Staff regarding the best military doctrine for $COUNTRY$'s current situation reached a tentative agreement in $CAPITAL$ earlier today. Given our present strategic situation, three proposals were put forth for final approval:\n\nYounger officers insisted on the advantages of modern communication technology between branches and even individual units in a new 'Network-Centric' war. More veteran officers considered the use of these emerging communications technologies for a soft-power approach on a 'Hybrid Warfare' engagement. Lastly, some officers would rather update the old 'People's War' doctrine to modern warfare, to better engage our population in an all-out war.\n\nAfter debating their merits and flaws with the officer corps, the leadership of $COUNTRY$ decided to pick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_1133_DESC;Over the last few months, our officer corps has been working in refining the Asymmetric War doctrine used by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Armed Forces to include the latest advances in technology and communications. They have refurbished an old doctrine's name, and called the new doctrine 'People's War under Modern Conditions.' This uses high-tech armament and engages modern communication networks to better prepare our people for a protracted conflict.\n\nAlternatively, younger officers and pundits are calling for a meeting of the General Staff in $CAPITAL$ to implement different doctrines that are, in their view, more aligned with the present national situation.

EVT_1210_NAME;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Service Rifle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_1210_DESC;For once, the minds in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$'s General Staff were in agreement: $COUNTRY$ will have a standardized rifle for her Armed Forces. A standard service rifle would facilitate training, improve combat effectiveness, simplify logistics, and cut down on costs.\n\nThere are, however, disagreements on which rifle to use.\n\nSome officers consider the adoption of a Battle Rifle, firing a full-size cartdridge to ensure greater range and penetration for each round. Conversely, younger officers favor the smaller and lighter Assault Rifle firing an intermediate cartdrige. While smaller and less powerful, it is more nimble and better suited for close-range engagements, and carries a lesser logistical burden.\n\nAfter deliberations with soldiers, officers and weapons manufacturers, it was decided to pick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_1220_DESC;The latest advances in firearm engineering, coupled with the ever-changing domestic and international situation has led to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$'s General Staff to review its standard-issue rifle.\n\nA vocal section within the General Staff advocate for the latest Battle Rifles, giving each soldier unparalleled firepower and range in the battlefield with high-powered cartridges, although this will increase their logistical burden. Most officers agree with adopting a modern Assault Rifle with an intermediate cartridge, as it combines effective power and range, while being much less bulky. Lastly, younger officers insist that modern warfare requires carbines more than fully-sized rifles: their smaller size means they have much less power and range, but they claim most engagements are at shorter distances where this is a non-factor.\n\nUltimately, after careful deliberation, it was decided to pick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
