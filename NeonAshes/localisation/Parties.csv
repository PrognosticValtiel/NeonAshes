social_democrat_uh;Social Democrats believe in increasing economic equality through government programs and regulations. Unlike the Socialists, they don't fully embrace Marxism, and even the most radical social democrats are unwilling to abandon the free market and democracy in the short term. And unlike the Liberals, they are much more friendly to state intervention in the economy and the political process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
socialist;Socialist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
socialist_uh;Socialists consider that the means of production of an economy should be collectivized, and not held by the few, in order to ensure social and economic equality. While moderate socialists believe in democratization and decentralization, more hard-line socialists consider hierarchical structures are necessary in order to ensure equitable distribution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
communist;Communist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
communist_uh;Communists, more aptly-called Marxist-Leninists, believe that a strong State should ensure economic collectivization through a top-down command economy and a single-party government. While they may allow some economic and political freedom, these are all subsumed to the designs of the Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
liberal;Liberal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
liberal_uh;Liberals consider that individual rights and liberties should predominate above governments and institutions. For this goal, they use the tools of the State to empower individuals and corporate entities, and look to provide an equalized playing field for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
anarcho_liberal;Libertarian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
anarcho_liberal_uh;Libertarians believe in a small (or "night-watchman") state: just large enough to enforce contracts, protect property, and deter against foreign and domestic aggression. While more moderate libertarians are content with policy rollbacks, more radical ones seek a total reformation of the State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
green;Green;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
green_uh;The Greens are ecologically-focused groups that believe that the chief duty of the State is to protect and aid the natural world. Moderates believe in limiting human activities to reduce nature's harm to a minimum, while more radical greens espouse a proactive approach, subsuming Man to Nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
conservative;Conservative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
conservative_uh;Conservatives believe in maintaining the societal and political status quo: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Depending on local customs, they may support a wide range of positions, but are unwilling to compromise from them unless pressured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
nationalist;Nationalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
nationalist_uh;Nationalists are guided by the general notion that the State has the duty to act on the best interests of the people of the nation. While most politicians would consider themselves nationalist under this definition, nationalists reject strict ideological lines, and are willing to use, modify, or disregard existing ideals, norms and institutions in order to further national goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
traditionalist;Traditionalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
traditionalist_uh;Traditionalists, as the name implies, are guided by traditions: past values, morals and institutions that ought to guide the country, its economy, and its people. They are often religious in nature, but occasional political or ideological strains of traditionalism are not unheard of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
ultranationalist;Ultranationalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
ultranationalist_uh;Ultranationalists believe in the supremacy of the State above all: individuals, corporations and institutions are all secondary to the goals of the nation. They believe in a strong government, uncompromising ideals, and the necessary destruction of the enemies of the State in order to achieve prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
