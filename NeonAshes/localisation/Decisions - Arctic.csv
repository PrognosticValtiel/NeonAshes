arctic_exploration_desc;We possess lands north of the Arctic circle which, due to their remoteness and harsh climate, have remained woefully underexplored. Given the scientific, economic, and military of the Arctic, we should engage in surveys of the region. This should open doors to better understand this remote region and, perhaps, acquire its vast mineral wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

arctic_research_desc;Our explorations and surveys of the Arctic region have identified potential mineral deposits, travel routes, and other issues of scientific interest. With this knowledge, we can deploy research stations to better investigate the Arctic, its geography, resources, climate, weather, fauna, and flora. Some of them could also be used to keep tabs on other Arctic neighbors, if needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

arctic_exploitation_desc;We have developed the necessary capabilities to acquire the Arctic mineral resources, and with minor investments we could open up large swaths to exploitation. Other than polar bears and environmentalists, the measure has broad support in $OURCAPITAL$, and many companies are just waiting the legislative approval to begin operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

arctic_militarization_desc;If we are to consider Arctic resources an integral part of our nation, we ought to protect them and, if needed, use it as staging grounds for military operations. While this will be undoubtedly seen as an aggressive action by the international community, it is in the best interests of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

arctic_colonization_desc;With the Arctic both rich and safe, a new generation of pioneers are flocking north of the Arctic circle. New settlements, ranging from old fishing towns getting a second wind to entirely new cities built on land and ice are springing up to home these adventurers. With more people comes more money, which brings more people, and so on. We should officially support them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

arctic_domination_desc;Our nation is a land of pioneers who have bravely conquered the North. And with unquestioning superiority, we can secure it against others. In other words, we can make the Arctic circle an integral part of our nation, and if others protest, they are welcomed to try. It is ours by right, and by might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
