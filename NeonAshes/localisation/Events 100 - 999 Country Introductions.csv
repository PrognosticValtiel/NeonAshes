EVT_107_NAME;The Republic of Quebec;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_107_DESC;The post-war period saw Canada embarking in a period of peace, prosperity, and neutrality, away from the turbulent conflicts in Asia and Europe, and Quebec was no exception.\n\nA relatively stable economy and a national focus against communism led to Maurice Duplessis, and his right-wing nationalist National Union Party, to hold onto power until his death in office in 1959 (and the death of his successor shortly thereafter). However, growing dissent against traditionalism led to a Liberal victory in 1960, and a quiet revolution towards secularization, a strong welfare state, and political realignment between federalists separatist factions in Quebec.\n\nAs Quebecois developed their own national identity, however, there were louder calls for increased autonomy, with some calling for an outright secession from Canada. Coupled with growing nationalism in western Canada, things were quickly reaching their boiling point by 1970...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_108_NAME;The Alaskan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_108_DESC;Ironically, the last State to join the Union was the first State that attempted secession.\n\nAfter World War II, Alaska became a key location for the United States to surveil and counter the Soviet Union, and to project power in the Northern Pacific and Arctic oceans. And as the territory became militarized, new mineral riches were discovered under its land: mining for oil, metals and rare materials became a brief, although enthusiastic, new gold rush. Empowered by these new riches, and clamoring for equal representation in Washington, Alaskans voted for statehood in 1959.\n\nAt the same time, the federal government was tightening its grip over Alaska's resources, seeking to federalize them. The wars in Europe and Asia were taking their toll in the economy, and raw materials were desperately needed for the war effort. Alaskans refused, but Washington saw the perfect opportunity to press the issue just a few years later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_180_NAME;The Unification of West Canada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_180_DESC;The winds of independence had been blowing over the Western provinces of Canada for the better part of a century. And when they struck, they disintegrated into three major countries: British Columbia, the Canadian Prairies, and the Northwestern Territories.\n\nAfter several decades of strife and bickering, however, we became the dominant country in the region, and managed to wrest control over the Pacific coast and the interior plains. This prompted $CAPITAL$ to declare the creation of a new Western Canadian state to consolidate the regional goals under one banner, and to stand up to possible geostrategic risks from the south and the east, not to mention to consolidate their control over the region.\n\nAs of today, a new flag rises in Western Canada...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_181_DESC;The rivalry between Ottawa and Quebec had reached a boiling point in the late 20th Century, and caused the disintegration of Eastern Canada into three major countries: Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime Provinces\n\nAfter several decades of strife and bickering, however, we became the dominant country in the region, and managed to wrest control over the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. This prompted $CAPITAL$ to declare the creation of a new Eastern Canadian state to consolidate the regional goals under one banner, and to stand up to possible geostrategic risks from the south and the west, not to mention to consolidate their control over the region.\n\nAs of today, a new flag rises in Eastern Canada...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_182_NAME;The Reunification of Canada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_182_DESC;Canada, as a state, ceased its existence in 1978, but the Canadian nation endured.\n\nAutonomous republics, loosely tied under the Canadian Compact, sought to carve their own path across the continent. Although regional capitals cheered, some were convinced that the ties that bind us are stronger than the differences, and that the reunification of Canada was, if not inevitable, at least likely.\n\nAnd they were right.\n\nToday, in $YEAR$, a new flag of Canada rises once more, hoisted from Vancouver to Quebec, from Ottawa to the Arctic. We will face the challenges of decades ago, of our forefathers, certainly with more knowledge, hopefully with more wisdom, than in their time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
