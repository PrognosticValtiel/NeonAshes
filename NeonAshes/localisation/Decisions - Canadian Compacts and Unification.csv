join_canada_compact_NEWS_LONG;The former Canadian nation of $COUNTRY$ has been admitted into the Canadian Compacts, despite its previous reluctance. Quoted as wanting to "turn a new leaf," diplomats see this as a break from their previous ways, and foresee greater stability for Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
join_canada_compact_NEWS_MEDIUM;Months of deliberation had concluded in the accession of $COUNTRY$ into the Canadian Compacts, a move sure to bring stability to Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
join_canada_compact_NEWS_SHORT;$COUNTRY$ has been admitted into the Canadian Compact, perhaps this time for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
join_canada_compact_desc;After the collapse of the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, the government of Canada proposed a Canadian Compact between the provinces to guarantee stability between them and the ratification of an independent Confederation. This was met with resistance from the Western provinces who felt abandoned by Ottawa, and by the Quebecois, mistrustful of the Anglo-Canadians. The end result was an acceptable, yet unstable compromise of several regions operating quasi-autonomously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

rescind_the_canadian_compacts_NEWS_LONG;The former Canadian nation of $COUNTRY$ has officially renounced its membership in the Canadian Compact, seeking absolute domestic and foreign autonomy. Experts disagree with their national goals, but it is likely to destabilize the rest of Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
rescind_the_canadian_compacts_NEWS_MEDIUM;Canadians once more in turmoil as the nation of $COUNTRY$ has left their Compact, showing a desire for full political autonomy. The consequences for the region are unclear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
rescind_the_canadian_compacts_NEWS_SHORT;Another Canadian nation has left the Compact. A sign of the times to come?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
rescind_the_canadian_compacts_desc;The Canadian Compacts were borne of the political instability of the 1960s, and have served well to maintain stability and peace thus far, but our ambitions cannot be shackled by antiquated agreements based upon a long-dead Confederation, and thus, it is in our best interests to abandon them. Given the difficulties of signing and ratifying them at first, it is unlikely, if not outright implausible, to rejoin them once we leave them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
