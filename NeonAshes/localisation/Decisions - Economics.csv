increase_interconnectedness_lvl_0_desc;The remains of our nation are mired into a Hobbesian anarchy, with threadbare national, political, or economic unity. Survivalism rules the day, and if we are to restore $COUNTRY$ to its former glory, we must begin the slow process of reconnecting our peoples, restarting our economy, and rekindling the national spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
