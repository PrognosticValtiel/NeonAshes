EVT_10100_NAME;The Rise in Western Alienation and Separatism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_10100_DESC;Despite the stability and prosperity of the region, so-called "Resource Wars" between the Prairie Provinces and Ottawa in the 70s strained the political fabric of British Columbia. The Social Credit Party remained the premier political force in the province, but the fears of Western Canada following on Quebec's footsteps, as well as pressure from fellow Social Credit parties, pressured the government in Victoria to ally with their neighbors on the calls for the restructuring of the Canadian state.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the national government in 1978, British Columbia sought patriation, rather than joining up with the Prairies, in order to maintain the political dominance of the Social Credit Party within the province and to prevent getting tied in further potential political conflicts between them and Eastern Canada or the former United States.\n\nWith independence, and leftover prosperity and stability from the last few decades, British Columbia is ready to chart its own course in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
