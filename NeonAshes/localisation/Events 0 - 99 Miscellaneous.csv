EVT_42_NAME;Deep Thought;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_42_DESC;The most brilliant and audacious scientists gathered today in $CAPITAL$, at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Academy of Science, to oversee the development of our latest and most powerful supercomputer, Deep Thought. The computer was custom-built for a single purpose: to give us The Answer.\n\nLead Researcher Adams stepped forward to type the question into the computer. He hesitated. Is this an answer that they really want to hear? Millenia of philosophical pondering tossed aside for a machine of wires and plastic? He recalled the epitaph of mathematician David Hilbert: "We must know. We will know."\n\nAnd with that, he typed it in. "What is The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything?"\n\nAfter a brief moment that felt like an eternity, the computer printed on the screen its reply:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_42_OPTA;"There is an answer. But, I'll have to think about it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_69_NAME;Exponential Growth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_69_DESC;The lauded mathematician turned towards the class.\n\n"Albert Einstein said that compound interest is the most powerful force in the Universe." He raised his finger. "Actually, he probably did not say that, but that doesn't make it any less true."\n\nHe turns to the whiteboard. "Exponential growth can quickly reach infinity," he adds, graphing a quickly rising curve, "and its opposite, exponential decay can make even the mightiest number fall to zero." This time, the curve steeply drops until it reaches zero.\n\n"We have, due to recent events, seen such a change in the population of $COUNTRY$. Anybody knows just about how much the population changed?\n\nA student in the back raised their hand. "Yes, Professor.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_69_OPTA;"The population doubled.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_69_OPTB;"The population was cut in half.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_76_NAME;The New Dark Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_76_DESC;Earlier this morning, a disturbing message arrived in $CAPITAL$:\n\n"$COUNTRY_ADJ$ cititzens! The nation's going... The nation's going down! No more communications, transmissions of any kind. We'll start again, live in villages! If you receive this, if you survive, then find us... find us!"\n\nShortly thereafter, we lost contact from several offices and settlements all over $COUNTRY$. We do not know what is happening, nor the origin of the message, but all reports indicate that our nation remains disconnected and shattered once more, and the vast majority of our people are now living in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
