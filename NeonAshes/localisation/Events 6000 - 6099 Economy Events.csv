EVT_6000_NAME;Economy Recovers from the Depression;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6000_DESC;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Journal of Economics published their latest economic report on the nation, confirming what the optimists in $CAPITAL$ have been saying for a while: the worst is already over.\n\nWhile the economy is still in a downturn, it is in a much better position than even just a few months ago: job growth, production and consumption have steadily risen, even if they still lag behind expectations, and economists are confident in a full recovery in a year or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6000_OPTA;At last, we can leave this chapter behind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6001_NAME;Economy Collapses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6001_DESC;All hopes for economic recovery have vanished. Within the last twenty-four hours, several major companies in $CAPITAL$ have declared insolvency, and the latest economic indicators point towards a sharp worsening of the recession.\n\nIf the economic situation continues to deteriorate, economists argue we'll enter a proper depression. Some economists (and dissenting political pundits) affirm that we already are in the midst of one, and that government intervention is necessary to protect the industrial sector and citizens from the worst of these unprecedented times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6001_OPTA;Our economy has hit rock-bottom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6002_NAME;Economy Recovers from the Recession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6002_DESC;The monthly reports from the $CAPITAL$ School of Economics, delivered a day early to the Ministry of Finance for review, are a breath of fresh air: the economy is no longer in a recession. The numbers are not entirely positive, and they argue that we would need to increase our growth to make up for the last few years, but we are finally out of the economic slump.\n\n In anticipation for the publishing of the report, politicians in $CAPITAL$ are scrambling to take credit for the good news, although in a rare show of support, even some opposition members have praised the current administration for their management of the crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6002_OPTA;Our economy is back on track!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6003_NAME;Economy Moves Towards Recession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6003_DESC;As soon as the report from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Journal of Economics broke the news, the people of $COUNTRY$ finally had official confirmation of their feelings in their daily lives: the economy wasn't doing well.\n\nDespite the constant assurances from $CAPITAL$, the economy had turned negative during the last quarter, and it is expected to continue this downward trend for the foreseeable future. Some activists are calling for the government to take active measures to get the economy back on track, or at least prevent further economic deterioration, although it is unclear how much leverage does the government actually have on the economic situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6003_OPTA;We are confident we will pull through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6004_NAME;Economy Grows Steady;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6004_DESC;For once, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Journal of Economics offers good news: the economy is growing at a steady rate, surpassing expectations. Politicians in $CAPITAL$ are praising the hard work and skill of the current government, industry leaders pat themselves on the back for their good business acumen, and even everyday folks enjoy their higher paychecks and standards of living.\n\nWhile experts disagree on how long this bonanza will last before returning to historical trend levels, they all concur in that this is an excellent opportunity for growth and investment all across $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6004_OPTA;Hard work and good management pays off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6005_NAME;Economy Slows Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6005_DESC;After many quarters of higher-than-expected growth, the economy seems to have returned to a lower, more stable growth rate.\n\nThe economic consensus is at least a year or two of mild economic growth before the next major expansion, but some pessimists are calling this the beginning of a long-term, sustained drop in economic activity that can potentially become a recession if unaddressed. Some, however, felt that this bonanza was too short-lived, and are calling on the government to adopt measures to boost the economy once more. For some, apparently, prosperity isn't good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6005_OPTA;Slow and steady wins the race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6006_NAME;Economy is Booming;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6006_DESC;The reports from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ministry of Industry had to be triple-checked: production was almost double-digits higher than last year in most major industries. This was not just a good quarter, or a good year: this was a full-on economic boom. All over $COUNTRY$ workers, managers, and entrepreneurs are saying the same thing: it is easy to sell, and they can hardly keep up with the increased demand for their products.\n\nWhile this is a good thing, economists in $CAPITAL$ are following the situation with some skepticism: too much of a good thing can lead to an overheated economy, though more positive economists claim this is just the natural result of the last few years of good management and investment in the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6006_OPTA;Nothing wrong with economic growth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6007_NAME;Economic Boom Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6007_DESC;While most did not expect the economic boom to last this long, few rejoiced when it ended. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ministry of Industry had reported that production was still growing at a rapid pace, but not as fast as the previous months.\n\nWhile we are still experiencing economic prosperity, economists concur that we won't see a period of such large growth anytime soon. A few argue that it's for the best, lest the economy becomes too hot to handle, while some others show confidence in the resilience of our economic institutions, and consider that we should encourage (and capitalize from) further growth to ensure our long-term prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6007_OPTA;Well, it was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6008_NAME;Adopt Expansionary Fiscal Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6008_DESC;Economists at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ministry of Finance gathered today in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the declining macroeconomic situation and potential government measures to address it.\n\nA vocal group of classical economists called for a non-intervention in the economy, although the majority of economists suggested that an increase in government spending, coupled with tax cuts, could lead to significant economic growth in the short and medium term, improving our economic standing in the long term. But even the most exuberant economists call for this to be a limited and temporary measure, lest the government crowds out the private sector, or the economy starts to overheat.\n\nThey presented their results to the Cabinet for policymaking, and decided to implement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_6009_DESC;Economists at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ministry of Finance gathered today in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the surging macroeconomic situation and potential government measures to address it.\n\nA vocal group of classical economists called for a non-intervention in the economy, although the majority of economists suggested that a cut in government spending, coupled with tax hikes, could lead to a measured slowdown in the economy in the short term, improving macroeconomic stability in the long term. But even the most bearish economists call for this to be a limited and temporary measure, lest the economy suffers too strong of a demand shock and enters into a recession.\n\nThey presented their results to the Cabinet for policymaking, and decided to implement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_6010_NAME;Hyperdeflation Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6010_DESC;After several months of hyperdeflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that deflation has slowed down to more manageable double-digits annually. The situation is far from ideal, but it is a significant step in the right direction.\n\nThe $COUNTRY$ Chamber of Commerce has announced, for the first time in several months, there are high-yield investments that are more profitable than sticking your money under the mattress, and money is starting to flow from hoarding to consumption and investment, and according to experts, monetary normalization is well within reach by next year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6010_OPTA;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6011_NAME;Deflation Slows Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6011_DESC;After several months of significant deflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that deflation has slowed down to a stable rate of a few percent per year. Economists in $CAPITAL$ are relieved: although they still consider negative inflation as undesirable, the currency is now stable enough to be widely used as a store of value for our citizens and foreign investors.\n\nAlthough most people are consuming and most industries are operating normally, experts at the $COUNTRY$ Ministry of Finance consider that positive inflation is necessary to have greater room for monetary policy and to discourage interest-free savings, thus increasing consumption, investment, and production in the medium and long term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6011_OPTA;A step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6012_NAME;Exiting Deflation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6012_DESC;After many months of deflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has issued a welcomed report: the price of goods and services has increased during the last quarter, and it will continue to do so in the near future. Inflation has finally turned positive.\n\nSome economists in $CAPITAL$ are satisfied with the low levels of inflation, signaling a very stable currency, but some others consider our current inflation level as insufficient for optimum output levels: they argue that a higher inflation rate, in the mid to high single digits, can stimulate the economy a lot more than our current low inflation levels, and would still be stable enough for savings and investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6012_OPTA;A bit of inflation can be a good thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6013_NAME;Inflation Creeps Up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6013_DESC;After several months of very low inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have increased to mid-single-digits per year. Economists at the $CAPITAL$ School of Economics generally consider this level to be an ideal compromise between currency stability and economic growth, and encourage the current administration to maintain this level.\n\nHowever, there is a small dissenting section of economists: some argue for a smaller inflation rate to cement the currency stability in the long term, while some others want to raise the rate of inflation to the high single-digits, as they consider such higher levels as better for economic growth, thus being better in the long term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6013_OPTA;We are in an ideal position right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6014_NAME;Inflation Creeps Up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6014_DESC;After several months of low inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have increased to upper single-digit per year. Some economists at $CAPITAL$ have raised the alarm of growing inflation, although most consider this higher level well within the acceptable range, and even ideal for economic growth.\n\nNot everybody agrees: the Foreign Ministry would rather see slower, more stable rates to lure in foreign investment and make our currency attractive for other countries. Similarly, more cautious economists suggest to lower the inflation rate to have greater maneouver range in case we need to stimulate the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6014_OPTA;A bit too high, but still within a good range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6015_NAME;Inflation Creeps Up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6015_DESC;After several months of moderate inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have increased to double-digits per year. Even the most optimistic economists think this is too high above the ideal range, and this is harming the currency's stability, the consumer's purchasing power, and the overall economic output.\n\nThe situation has raised the alarm in $CAPITAL$, where both critics and sympathizers of the government are calling for the administration to take action to control the rise in prices and prevent further economic deterioration, although some economists consider this to be just a transient phase of an exuberant economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6015_OPTA;The prices are rising too fast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6016_NAME;Inflation Creeps Up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6016_DESC;After several months of high inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have increased to almost triple-digits per year, and it has become a full-blown economic disaster. People are hoarding tangible goods, as their money loses value month after month, savings in local currency are scarce and dwindling, and wages can barely keep up with the rise of the cost of living\n\nThe top economists at the $CAPITAL$ School of Economics are calling for immediate fiscal and monetary restraint from the government to curb inflation, to lower interest rates, and to apply the brakes on the economy. Even if prompt and decisive measures are taken, the economy is expected to suffer from the effects of very high inflation for many months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6016_OPTA;The situation is extremely dire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6017_NAME;Inflation Creeps Up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6017_DESC;After several months of very high inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have increased to triple-digits per year. This is nothing short of catastrophic, as the value of the currency depreciates weekly. Industries are unable to predict future economic situations or to keep up with wages, and low-denomination bills have lost almost all of their value, used for gift-wrapping and wallpaper by crafty citizens.\n\nWhile inflation has many sources, many economists in $CAPITAL$ blame a severly overheated economy, coupled with generous government spending, and consider severe austerity measures to decrease inflation to more reasonable levels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6017_OPTA;Oh no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6018_NAME;Entering Hyperinflation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6018_DESC;After several months of galloping inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that $COUNTRY$ is officially experiencing hyperinflation, with an almost triple-digit increase in prices each month. While the situation was dire, no one - except for the most pessimistic economists and pundits - expected the situation to deteriorate this much.\n\nThe currency is, for all intents and purposes, worthless, and foreign currencies and barter have become the norm for many in the economy. Restaurants have stopped printing menus, posting prices on boards against the wall, to change them up to multiple times a day. The preferred method of accounting is by kilograms of bills.\n\nThe future of our economy, and our country, is looking grim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6018_OPTA;On the bright side, we're all millionaires now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6019_NAME;Adopt Expansionary Monetary Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6019_DESC;Economists at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank gathered today in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the declining monetary situation and potential government measures to address it.\n\nA vocal group of classical economists refused to engage in monetary intervention, although the majority of economists suggested that monetary expansion through quantitative easing will stimulate the economy by expanding the monetary base, boosting consumption (and inflation) in the short term. But even the most exuberant economists call for this to be a limited and temporary measure, lest the government crowds out the private sector, or inflation grows beyond control.\n\nThey presented their results to the Cabinet for policymaking, and decided to implement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_6019_OPTE;Nothing. On second thought, this is not the right time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6020_NAME;Hyperinflation Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6020_DESC;After several months of triple-digit monthly inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that hyperinflation is officially over. The news, however, was not met cheerfully by the citizens of $COUNTRY$, as the nation still suffers from triple-digit annual inflation, and the lingering effects of hyperinflation in the economy and the collective memory mutes any positive developments.\n\nExperts and economists in $CAPITAL$ are cautiously optimistic about the development, however, as it either points to successful government policies taking effect, or to the worse of the inflationary woes running its course. While few can forecast a return to normalcy anytime soon, it's clear the worst times are behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6020_OPTA;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6021_NAME;Inflation Creeps Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6021_DESC;After several months of galloping inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that triple-digit annual inflation is officially over. The experts and economists warn of caution, as our current level of inflation is merely "very high" instead of "extraordinary", and call for continued government policies to reduce it even further.\n\nStill, there are positive developments: restaurants are changing their menus monthly instead of weekly, people are starting to use their savings account once more, and low-denomination bills are used as currency instead of gift wrap and packaging material. If this trend continues, experts and economists expect to have inflation fully under control in a year or two, at most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6021_OPTA;A step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6022_NAME;Inflation Creeps Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6022_DESC;After several months of very high inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have decreased to low double-digits per year. This is still not ideal, but it provides measurable progress in the struggle against inflation and stability in the national price index.\n\nWith the reduction of inflation, there has been a boost in the savings rate, which has led to a boost in output and productivity in the short term, and while most economists are not concerned of potential economic overheating right now, it is a distinct possibility, and potentially boosting the inflation rate once more. Thus, experts and pundits in $CAPITAL$ are calling for active government measures to decrease (and keep down) the inflation rate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6022_OPTA;A step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6023_NAME;Inflation Creeps Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6023_DESC;After several months of high inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have decreased to moderate, upper single-digit per year. This is starting to approach the macroeconomic ideals espoused by economists and experts of the ideal inflation rate, and both domestic and foreign entrepreneurs are starting to consider our currency stable enough for significant investment.\n\nAt this point, our inflation rate is high enough to foster strong consumption and production, yet stable enough to guarantee price stability in the short term, and we can start to leverage these advantages both within and outside our borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6023_OPTA;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6024_NAME;Inflation Creeps Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6024_DESC;After several months of moderate inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have decreased to low, mid-single-digits per year. According to experts and scientists at the $CAPITAL$ School of Economics, this is the ideal sweet spot for inflation: high enough to ensure production and consumption, and low enough to ensure price stability in the medium term.\n\nAs our currency stabilizes, we are seeing increased investment from both domestic and foreign entrepreneurs, and our currency is starting to be used by less-stable neighbors as a reserve currency, thereby increasing our international leverage and soft power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6024_OPTA;This will surely improve our currency's stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6025_NAME;Inflation Creeps Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6025_DESC;After several months of low inflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the inflation levels in $COUNTRY$ have decreased to very low single-digits per year, just above zero. Conservative economists consider this ideal, although some others think that slightly higher inflation can lead to greater consumption and economic output without significantly harming monetary stability.\n\nWe are reaping the benefits of a stable currency: it is used by citizens, investors, and even foreign nations as a reliable store of value, and to quote an op-ed in the $CAPITAL$ Daily News, our currency is "as good as gold". And at least for the foreseeable future, that will continue to be the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6025_OPTA;Strong and stable, what's not to like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6026_NAME;Entering Deflation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6026_DESC;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has issued a concerning report: the price of goods and services has dropped during the last quarter, and it will seemingly continue to do so in the short term. In other words, we are experiencing negative inflation, or deflation.\n\nAt face value, some deflation isn't too concerning: sometimes the macroeconomic conditions lead to appreciation of the currency when compared to goods and services in an economy, and the rate of deflation is very low. However, if the situation continues, there will be a shift from consumption to savings, decreasing investment and output in the medium and long term. Thus, economists in $CAPITAL$ are encouraging the government to adopt measures to return to positive inflation as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6026_OPTA;What's so bad about a little currency appreciation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6027_NAME;Deflation Worsens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6027_DESC;After several months of deflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that the appreciation of the currency is accelerating, and price drops are sustained and generalized across the economy. Wages, previously unaffected by deflation, have started to recede as consumption and output keeps dropping.\n\nEconomists in $CAPITAL$ are concerned that this can have a feedback effect in the general economy: as prices and wages drop, people will hoard money, reducing spending, reducing production, and reducing prices and wages even more. This deflationary spiral can significantly harm our economy, and they are urging for immediate and substantial government action to exit deflation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6027_OPTA;I never thought I'd miss inflation so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6028_NAME;Entering Hyperdeflation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6028_DESC;After several months of severe deflation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Bureau of Econometrics has announced that we are entering a period of hyperdeflation. Experts and economists in $CAPITAL$ are alarmed by the speed of the price drops, calculated to be in the high double-digits annually, and are calling for immediate and sustained government action to stop the appreciation of the currency.\n\nMoney hoarding has become the most profitable investment in $COUNTRY$, and industries are shutting down all over the country as the price of goods and services collapse faster than wages and raw materials. It is imperative to exit the hyperdeflationary spiral for the economic health of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_6028_OPTA;Go out and buy stuff, people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_6029_DESC;Economists at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank gathered today in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the overheated economic situation and potential government measures to address its high inflation.\n\nA vocal group of classical economists refused to engage in monetary intervention, although the majority of economists suggested that monetary contraction through the sale of government bonds and assets to remove money from the economy. This will cool down the economy by shrinking the monetary base, reducing consumption (and inflation) in the short term. But even the most exuberant economists call for this to be a limited and temporary measure, lest the government dampen the economy too much, or cause deflation.\n\nThey presented their results to the Cabinet for policymaking, and decided to implement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
